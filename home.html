                        When the skies cloud over and the rain falls in torrents, we feel pensive. A balmy moonlit night can awaken the lover in us. Such is the transformative power of nature’s beauty. In the movie, ‘The Silence of the Lambs’, the cannibalistic psychiatrist Hannibal Lector who is in a maximum security prison tells Clarice Starling, the FBI officer, that he wants to be transferred to a facility where he can have a room with a window that looks out on the sky.
                        Even evil surrenders before the beauty of nature. It has been observed that patients in hospital recover faster if they are in a room with windows that offer a pleasant view. Beyond providing pure pleasure, nature’s beauty can therefore offer therapy for sick minds and bodies. So it is all the more essential that we do our best to preserve it for future generations.
                        Every time we cut down a tree, every time an oil spill despoils the ocean, let us remember that we are destroying the most precious inheritance we can leave behind for our children.
                        When the skies cloud over and the rain falls in torrents, we feel pensive.
